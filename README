###### Brewing Guide ######

To obtain fruits for brewing, create some VINE and you will grow some GRPE, APPL, ORNG, AGAV and JUNP.

WSKY making process:
Mix some YEST with SUGR, making ALCO. Put some CHRW next to the ALCO, and you'll get WSKY!
 
VODK brewing process:
Make some YWTR by combining YEST and WATR, then malt some GRAN by pouring WATR over it. Combine YWTR with MGRN. That'll get you MASH. Heat the MASH, which makes ALCV and WTRV, and coll the ALCV to get VODK!
 
BEER brewing process:
Make some YWTR by combining YEST and WATR, then malt some GRAN by pouring WATR over it. Combine YWTR with MGRN. That'll get you MASH. Add HOPS to the MASH, which makes MALT, and heat the MALT to 50 degrees or more, and your BEER should be ready! Also, if you apply more than 2.5 pressure, you'll get FOAM.
 
WINE making process: 
Crush some GRPE with pressure, making GRPJ. Wait a minute or so, and it'll turn into WINE and some GRPB. Make WINE touch some CHRW, and your very own AWNE will be ready soon!
 
CIDR making process:
Crush some APPL, making APLJ. Add some YEST over the APLJ, and it will ferment into fresh CIDR!
 
RUM making process:
Crush some SUGC to release SUGR and MOLS. Sort it because we'll only use MOLS. Add some YEST or YWTR to the MOLS to get PRUM. Heat PRUM, and your RUM will be ready in no time!

GIN making process:
Mix some YEST with JUNP to release the awesome taste of GIN.

VRMT making process:
Mix AWNE with JUNP to unleash the flavors of VRMT.

TEQL making process:
Take some AGAV, heat it and place it under pressure. Wait for the AGVJ you made to ferment and WORT will appear. Heat the WORT and your TEQL will be ready.

TRPS making process:
Mix some ORNG with YEST to make some triple sec(TRPS).

##### Cocktail Guide #####
